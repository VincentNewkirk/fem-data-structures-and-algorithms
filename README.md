# Front End Masters Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo goes through the coding challenges presented in Front End Master's Data Structures and Algorithms video course. Exercises can be found [here](https://github.com/kuychaco/algoClass).

# Challenges

### Pseudoclassical JavaScript
```constructors.js```

Create a class, add methods to the class and create an instance of the class.

## Stacks

#### Stack String Exercise
```stackStringExercise.js```

Create a 'storage' (stack) string on a class. Then add 'menu items' to the 'storage'. Create methods that allow you to push and pop strings on and off the stack as well as a method that returns the number of items on the stack.

*This was difficult because the stack had to be a string.*

### Stack Exercise
```stackExercise.js```

Create a stack (Last in First out) with an object as the underlying data structure. Not allowed to use arrays or native push/pop methods.
