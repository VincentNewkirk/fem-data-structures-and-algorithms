This repo goes through the coding challenges presented in Front End Master's Data Structures and Algorithms video course.

## Challenges

### Pseudoclassical JavaScript
Create a class, add methods to the class and create an instance of the class.

### Stacks

#### Stack String Exercise
Create a 'storage' (stack) string on a class. Then add 'menu items' to the 'storage'. Create methods that allow you to push and pop strings on and off the stack as well as a method that returns the number of items on the stack.
```This was difficult because the stack had to be a string.```
